My family originates from East Africa and during travels back the stark contrast in attitudes towards health and even health expectations compared to the UK show the massive gap in healthcare that remains unfilled.</p>

My parents worked for various NGO’s ranging from Uganda to Tanzania and South Africa. It was at University where I met the rest of the group and realised that we shared a common goal. I completed my BSc and MSc in Economics and Finance. I am of the firm belief that my educational and personal background will enable me to become a force for change and ultimately return to Africa in a capacity similar to my parents. I am currently working as a Senior Policy Advisor for the UK Civil Service on the European Fast Stream. Among other things I have worked on developing Care and Support Guidance, and am bringing my expertise in Finance and Management to this charity to ensure its sustained growth and success.</p>

                    <p class="personal-blog">My time as a medical student has made me really appreciate how great the NHS is. My elective in the Philippines further reinforced this as a result of witnessing a system so deprived of resources in contrast to ours. It was distressing to observe patients not receiving treatment because they could not afford medications or surgery. While doctors were mostly reliant on clinical judgement rather than the advanced machines we have such as MRI. This experience certainly inspired me to want to help people gain access to sustainable health care and through this charity i hope we achieve this.</p>

                    <p class="personal-blog">I was born in Canada, and from a young age, realized that medicine was the path that I wanted to pursue. Part of my family is from Pakistan, and having travelled there several times during my childhood and adolescence, I gained a deep appreciation for how important health care and equality of access to healthcare is. This is especially so in developing nations where morbidity and mortality appear to be inversely proportionate to health care services in the region. These issues are all preventable with the right interventions, which we hope to provide. I was also inspired by my grandfather who was a doctor for many years in Pakistan, and made an outstanding difference in the public healthcare sector. Furthermore, I have a particular interest in Paediatrics and Women’s Health, which I plan to pursue further. l will be able to bring my experience of volunteering in the public healthcare sector, as well as my interest in particularly vulnerable groups in society (women and children) to this charity, to ensure that equal access to healthcare can be brought to, and sustained within developing nations.</p>

                    <p class="personal-blog">Born and raised in Canada, I moved to the United Kingdom and am now currently studying medicine. I have developed a keen interest in paediatrics and medicine in developing countries. One of the reasons why I like these areas of medicine is because they present opportunities to have a great impact on the trajectory of someone’s health. I spent some time in a rural hospital in South Africa and saw how important basic healthcare like nutrition, rehydration, hygiene, antibiotics and education can be in areas where people are dying from preventable diseases. My experience in South Africa also opened my eyes to how difficult it was to provide effective healthcare. As I go forward, I hope to understand the difficulties face and to see more people have access to healthcare.</p>
